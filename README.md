lttng_state
===========

The objective of this project is to prototype a subset of a state system
for LTTng traces, which depends only on the Babeltrace python bindings.
The original modules were forked from
[lttng-analyses](https://github.com/jdesfossez/lttng-analyses) and are
being refactored into a package that is easily usable from any other
python script.
